# My Personal Website

This website is generated by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). It uses customized [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/) and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


# How to build a site with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and deploy with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Step 1: Install Hugo

sudo apt-get install Hugo
```

## Step 2: Create a new Hugo site

I picked [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt)

You should get a build process and a link to the website:
