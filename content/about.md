Greetings,

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Horia Delicoti, and Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer living in Romania/Bucharest. Iâ€™m happy you found me.
I love making and sharing things I have learned from the world.

ðŸ–‹ I am practicing my writing. You can take a look through my [personal wiki](https://horia-delicoti.gitbook.io/wiki/) where I share everything I learn.
